							<h3><b>T1--Piano training model</b></h3>
							<p> 
							<!--
							Adults are more willing to do more repeating practises while their flexibility are limited. Therefore, the training can be designed very mechanical and step-by-step. For me, I just let my adult students practise the same piece for many times. I strictly set clear targets in tempo, loudness, and expressions just as training a performance model. For example, I would say the scale of C major should be completed in the tempo of 120 in two octaves with no stops. Whenever the targets are achieved, I will make the requirements more "tricky" until the piece sounds great. 
						-->
							There should be a model to adjust the training targets for learners and do the supervision to help them learn how to play, and the specific targets of the model can be designed as follows.
							<br>
							1. Evaluate the performer's strengths and weaknesses from a few dimentions like:
							<br>a) loudness
							<br>b) speed
							<br>c) coordination
							<br>d) number of wrong notes
							<br>e) etc. 
							<br>
							2. Design homework for the performer to enhance the weknesses and make the strengths stronger as well.
							<br>
							<br>
							</p>
							<h3><b>T2--Piano playing model</b></h3>
							<p>
							There are several features in human's performances listed as follows:
							<br>
							1. Human may have their own recreation in playing the scores.
							<br>
							2. Human's rhythms may be more casual and more imperfect. For example, the trills played in both crescendo and rita.
							<br>
							We could design a performing model based on such facts rather than just set the parameters of the pitches, tempos, etc.  
							<br>
							<br>
							</p>

							<h3><b>T3--Human hand model</b></h3>
							<p>
							The existing piano playing programs do not consider such factors:
							<br>
							1. The coordination of human's left hand and right hand varied according to how long they practised.
							<br>
							2. Human may play some wrong notes due to the limitation of their hands.
							<br>
							3. The timber of notes are affected by how fingers touch the keys.
							<br>
							We could design a model cased on the structures of human's hands to simulate a more realistic piano performance. Maybe we need to coorporate with a med school. 
							<br>
							<br>
							</p>
							<h3><b>T4--Piano difficulty model</b></h3>
							<p>
							<!--A student once asked me how to measure her level of playing the piano. I told her to say that she can play a famous work like Mozart's KV545 or Czerny's Etude Op.299, but she thought that is too ambiguous. Then I had to tell her to take some exams like ABRSM. However, sometimes we cannot describe how hard a work is. Therefore, a model to evaluate the difficulty of piano works is necessary. -->
							<br>
							We can give an objective score to describe how difficult a piano piece is.
							<br>
							We have GiantMIDI-Piano Dataset which can be used to train the difficulty evaluation model.
							We can use the unsupervised learning to cluster the performance in similar difficulty and give them labels, and we can give some examples:
							<br> 1. The speed for Etudes in more than 1000 notes per minute can be discribed as difficult, which can be a rule-based algorithm.
							<br> 2. The variation among the key-touching in a piece. There should be a catagory for different key-touching methods.
							<br> 3. etc. 
							<br>
							The comprehensive score for different dimentions could be illustrated in a chart.

						<h3><b>T4--Hearing perception model</b></h3-->

						<!--h2>Introduction</h2-->
						<!--p> 
							Unlike adults, I focus on cultivating solfeggio for kids in a natural way, and I want to model the way how children master it. 

							It is amazing that kids can imitate everything much faster and easier than adults. Many kids can sing which note they plays in "do re mi" or "C D E". I think that it is more like a Pulse Code Modulation sampling for the music signals in their brains. However, for adults who cannot be changed from movable doh, their modeling for music are more close to encoding the diffences. I think that the major difference is the reaction to 440Hz rather than age. With enough delibirate training, we can make sure than people can remember the intervals in major and minor scales, but it is hard to make a mapping from 440Hz to hearing. For musical perception, it must be an interesting topic.

						<p> 
							For the professional pianists and opera singers, they can even perform well when they are sick or drunk. However, most people have to do some warm-up to make their perfances do not mess up, which is necessary and meaningful. I will show you some of my methods in warming myself up and share some of my original etudes.

							The excellent voice leading can always make you feel that "This must please the God and I'll definately be saved.", which is common in the churches. The basic rules of harmony in classical music are strict and logical, ensuring the music be harmonic. Some interesting stories about my composing learning may give you some inspirations.

						<h3><b>T5--Pronunciation training model</b></h3>

						<!--h2>Introduction</h2-->
						<p> 
							For beginners in learning vocal, they may feel difficult to control the breathes, the resonance positions, the vibrados, etc. It is unrealistic to model all the listed and make the model just replace a vocal teacher. However, maybe some of the listed can be modeled to do some help.
							<br>
							1. Recognize the rhythm of reading the lyrics, and make it follow the accompaniment strictly.
							<br>
							2. Check the pronunciations for each phonome in the lyrics.
							<br>
							Besides correcting the pronunciation in singing, the model can also help in learning performance, poem recitation, etc.
