							<h2>
							Welcome!</h2>
							<p>
								This is Joy, a RA student in <a href="http://musicxlab.com/" target="_blank" > musicX lab </a> in NYU Shanghai.I am interested in signal processing, statistical learning and deep neural networks in computer music. I graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University major in Information Engineering, during which I was a RA student in  <a href="https://bat.sjtu.edu.cn" target="_blank" >SJTU Brain-inspired Application Techonology Center </a>. <br>
								My research interest can be ranked as follows:<br>
								1. Audio/Music Signal Processing<br>
								2. Music Information Retrieval<br>
								3. Deep Music Generation<br>
								 
								<br />
								<br />
								In this website, you can find most of my works, which are devided into four catergories as follows.<br>



								<!--I started learning Bel Carto since I was 16. Started from vocalises, art songs to arias, I knew about the total course of the gradually improving of my voice, which is amazing. Vocal music is a performing art, besides the voice, the facial expression and body movements should also be telling. I 'm always focusing on my overall status during my performing, from the outfits, makeups to the lights of the stage.

								I have practised learning piano for 18 years. I enjoy playing classical musics, practising basic skills. I even compose some etudes for myself to improve my fingering, flexibility and speed. I have a perfect pitch, in order to strenthen it, I designed various interesting exercises.

								I have joined in various choirs for more than 16 years.

								My major in college is Information Engineering, which sounds a little wierd to my music background. Actually, this major helps me to deal with lots of things from a rational place.-->
